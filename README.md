## 📄 Overview

**Slopsquatting** is a new class of cybersecurity threats introduced by hallucinated package names in AI-generated code. Malicious actors exploit these hallucinations by registering similarly named packages in public repositories, compromising software supply chains.

This repository contains the theoretical proposal of a defense mechanism—**HADR (Hallucination-Aware Dependency Resolver)**—a conceptual framework designed to proactively detect and prevent such attacks during development.

## 🧰 Key Contributions

- ⚠️ **Identifies a novel vulnerability** at the intersection of LLMs and public package ecosystems (e.g., PyPI, npm).
- 🧠 **Introduces HADR**, a theoretical, proactive system for real-time verification of dependencies.
- 🔍 **Outlines core components**, including:
  - LLM Output Inspector
  - Package Repository Verifier
  - Risk Scoring Engine
  - Developer Feedback Module
- 🧩 Envisions integration with IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and enterprise development workflows.

## 🏗️ HADR Architecture

> _The architecture is modular, IDE/plugin-ready, and CI/CD compatible._

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- 💡 Real-time detection of hallucinated dependencies in developer IDEs
- 🛡️ Securing CI/CD pipelines before deployment
- 📚 Educating developers on hallucination risks and safe package practices
- 🏢 Enforcing enterprise package whitelisting and policy-based controls

---

## 🚧 Future Development Roadmap

- ✅ **Prototype Development** (initial support for Python & JavaScript)
- 🧪 **Empirical Testing**: Analyze false positives/negatives in real-world usage
- 📦 **Dataset Curation**: Benchmark datasets of hallucinated vs. real packages
- 👥 **User Feedback Studies**: Evaluate trust, usability, and performance

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome collaborators interested in:
- Implementing HADR as an open-source tool
- Integrating with LLM providers and IDEs
- Security researchers looking to validate detection strategies
